# Multi-User chat Application
A basic real-time chat application built with Python using the socket module. It allows multiple users to chat together by connecting to a server. Users can set their own nicknames, and the server can broadcast messages to everyone. It also includes simple moderation commands and uses threading to handle multiple users at the same time.
